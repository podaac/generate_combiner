# Setting for where to look for SST/SST4/OC files for combining into one file.
#
# Notes: 
#   1.  These values were set by the developer and must be re-set by the 
#       operator to the actual values for TEST/OPS.
#   2.  All the directory names, e.g MODIS_AQUA_L2_SST_OBPG_QUICKLOOK, 
#       MODIS_TERRA_L2_SST_OBPG_QUICKLOOK must be kept as is because that is the
#       name of the dataset.  You can change the top level directory above them.
#   3.  The configuration cannot perform environment variable substitution.  The 
#       values on the right hand side must be literal.
